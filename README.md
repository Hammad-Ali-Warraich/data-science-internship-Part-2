# Data Science & Analytics Internship Tasks

This repository contains solutions for three data science tasks focusing on classification, clustering, and time series forecasting.

## Tasks

### 1. Customer Churn Prediction 
**Objective:**  
Identify customers who are likely to leave the bank using historical customer data.  

**Dataset:**  
Bank Customer Churn Dataset  

**Techniques Used:**  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Categorical feature encoding  
- Classification using machine learning models  
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

**Outcome:**  
The model identifies high-risk customers and highlights key factors influencing churn.

### 3. Energy Consumption Time Series Forecasting
**Objective:**  
Forecast household energy consumption using historical power usage data.  

**Dataset:**  
Household Power Consumption Dataset  

**Techniques Used:**  
- Time series parsing and feature engineering (hour, weekday/weekend)  
- Forecasting using ARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost  
- Evaluation using MAE and RMSE  
- Visualization of actual vs predicted values  

**Outcome:**  
Forecasting models capture trends and seasonality in energy usage, enabling better energy management.
